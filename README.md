Class Project for CSE 40647

Our code is pretty simple to run, just run
	$python3 vor.py
from this directory and the shell will start up.
From here the user is prompted to run a specific task.
The results of task2 and task3 are included in this folder because
they took a very long time to execute. So DO NOT run task 2 or task 3 again unless you want to wait for the file generation to complete, which takes multiple hours.
The rest of the tasks should be pretty straightforward, printing output to the screen.
Sometimes the shell will prompt the user to enter more information about the algorithm, like min_sup. This allows the user to get different results based on the information that they provide.

Notice that we use an FP-Growth algorithm, but that algorithm is not ours. We have only adapted it to work in python3. It is originally part of the python-fp-growth package by enaeseth on Github.

The rest of the code was written by us, and those algorithms can be found in in naive_bayes.py or decision_tree directory respectivey.
